## Our training environment

- If you are attending a tutorial or workshop:

  - a VM has been provisioned for each student

- If you are doing or re-doing this course on your own, you can:

  - install Docker locally (as explained in the chapter "Installing Docker")

  - install Docker on e.g. a cloud VM

  - use https://www.play-with-docker.com/ to instantly get a training environment

---

## Our Docker VM

*This section assumes that you are following this course as part of
a tutorial, training or workshop, where each student is given an
individual Docker VM.*

- The VM is created just before the training.

- It will stay up during the whole training.

- It will be destroyed shortly after the training.

- It comes pre-loaded with Docker and some other useful tools.

## What *is* Docker?

- "Installing Docker" really means "Installing the Docker Engine and CLI".

- The Docker Engine is a daemon (a service running in the background).

- This daemon manages containers, the same way that a hypervisor manages VMs.

- We interact with the Docker Engine by using the Docker CLI.

- The Docker CLI and the Docker Engine communicate through an API.

- There are many other programs and client libraries which use that API.

## Checking your Virtual Machine

Once logged in, make sure that you can run a basic Docker command:

.small[
```bash
$ docker version
